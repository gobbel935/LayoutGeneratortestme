# 1.4.0

- **Bug fix**: Fast click fix — when "Use player clicks" is enabled, rapidly clicking
  in spider and other non-flying gamemodes no longer silently drops taps. Root cause:
  `m_stateRingJump` is transient and can be cleared before `update()` runs; the fix
  reads the trail queue (already populated by the `updateJump` hook) to detect taps
  that completed between frames. Togglable via the new "Fast click fix" setting.
- **Bug fix**: Fixed a per-frame memory leak — `PlayerData` is now stack-allocated
  instead of heap-allocated with no corresponding `delete`.
- **New setting**: "Blocks" toggle — disable block-type objects (platforms, landing
  blocks) so the generator produces ring / pad / portal-only gameplay.
- **New setting**: "Spawn chance" (0–100%) — probability that an object actually
  spawns at each placement opportunity. 100 % is identical to previous behaviour;
  lower values create sparser layouts.
